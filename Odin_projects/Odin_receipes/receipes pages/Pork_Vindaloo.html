        <li>1 (3 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>8 whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>4 whole cloves</li>
        <li>Â½ cup vinegar, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 pound lean pork, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>8 fresh curry leaves</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions Instructions Checklist</h2>

      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>
        Grind onion, ginger, garlic, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, cinnamon stick,
        peppercorns, and cloves with just enough vinegar to keep the mixture
        moving in a blender or food processor until you have a thick paste.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
        Mix remaining vinegar and water together in a large bowl. Add pork cubes
        to the bowl and thoroughly rinse the meat with the vinegar mixture;
        drain. Pat pork dry with paper towel.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
        Mix the paste and pork cubes together in a clean bowl, assuring the pork
        cubes are coated in paste. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Marinate in
        refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry curry
        leaves in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add marinated
        pork, tomatoes, and turmeric; cook and stir until the tomatoes are
        completely softened, about 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <p>
        Season the pork mixture with salt. Pour enough pork stock over the
        mixture to assure everything is at least half-submerged. Bring the stock
        to a simmer, place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low,
        and simmer until the pork is completely tender, 1 to 2 hours.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <p>
        Remove lid from skillet and continue to simmer the mixture until the
        sauce is very thick, about 10 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
