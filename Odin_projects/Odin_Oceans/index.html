          Our oceans are under attack by climate change, overfishing The vast
        </h1>
        <p>
          bodies of water surrounding the continents are critical to life on
          Earth. But overfishing and global warming threaten to leave oceans
          barren.

         <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>
          The ocean covers more than 70 percent of the earth's surface.
          <br /><br />
          About 94 percent of the earth's wildlife is found in the ocean.
          <br /><br />
          More than 70 percent of the earth's oxygen is produced by the ocean.
          <br />
          <br />
          Five percent of the land belonging to the United States is surrounded
          by the ocean. <br />
          <br />
          The sun is what makes the ocean blue. <br /><br />
          The deepest part of the ocean is called the Mariana Trench, which is
          around 7 miles deep and is located in the South Pacific Ocean.
          <br /><br />
          The water pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench is eight tons
          per square inch. This means the pressure there is enough to crush you.
          <br /><br />
          Coral creates its own “sunscreen” by producing coral fluoresce that
          protects the algae found in coral. <br />
          <br />
          The largest mountain range is found underwater and is called the
          Mid-Oceanic Ridge that is around 40,390 miles long. <br />
          <br />
          The loudest sound ever recorded was made by an iceberg. In 1997, the
          sound was recorded and named, “The Bloop.” It was said to be heard
          from more than 3,000 miles away. <br />
          <br />
          Ice found in the ocean is safe enough to drink. You first must let the
          fresh ice sit to let the brine release. After that, the ice is safe to
          consume. <br />
          <br />
          Ninety percent of the earth's volcanic activity happens in the ocean.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is estimated there are more than 3 million shipwrecks on the ocean
          floor. <br />
          <br />
          There are more historic artifacts under the sea than in all of the
          world's museums. <br />
          <br />
          The great barrier reef in Australia can be seen from the moon. <br />
          <br />
          Fourteen percent of the earth's protein comes from the ocean. <br />
          <br />
          The largest blue whale on record was 108 feet long. That's as tall as
          an 11-story building. <br /><br />
          One percent of the ocean is covered in coral reefs. <br />
          <br />
          Only five percent of the ocean's floor has been mapped in detail.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are more than 400 species of sharks in the ocean.
